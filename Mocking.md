## Mock Objects:
Mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in a controlled way. They are primarily used in testing to isolate specific units of code by replacing dependencies with these mock objects.

Function API:

If your function is making a call to an API, you might prefer to mock the API instead of executing the actual call. When writing tests for such a function, it’s common to simulate the API call rather than perform a real request.

Basic Example:

In the context of pytest mocking, for example, if you have two functions—count_apples, which retrieves the number of apples from the fridge, and make_apple_pie, which adjusts the ingredients based on that count and returns the apple pie—you would mock the count_apples function to simulate it returning a count of 3 apples, enabling you to test the make_apple_pie function without performing the actual count in the fridge.
